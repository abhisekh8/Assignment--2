//Write a program to create a Book class with the following member variables: bookId, 
bookName, and price. Implement the appropriate constructor and methods for this 
class.
Additionally, create a driver class to:
i. Instantiate two Book objects.
ii. Compare the books based on their price.
iii. Print the details of both books.
Note: Override the toString() and equals() methods



CODE:-
class Book {
    private int bookId;
    private String bookName;
    private double price;

    
    public Book(int bookId, String bookName, double price) {
        this.bookId = bookId;
        this.bookName = bookName;
        this.price = price;
    }

   
    public int getBookId() {
        return bookId;
    }

    public String getBookName() {
        return bookName;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Book ID: " + bookId + ", Book Name: " + bookName + ", Price: " + price;
    }
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
   if (this == obj) {
        return true;
    }
    if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
        return false;
    }
    Book otherBook = (Book) obj;
    return Double.compare(otherBook.price, this.price) == 0;
}
}


public class Q2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        Book book1 = new Book(101, "Java", 450.50);
        Book book2 = new Book(102, "webdevelopment", 450.50);

       
        System.out.println("Book 1 Details: " + book1);
        System.out.println("Book 2 Details: " + book2);

        
        if (book1.equals(book2)) {
            System.out.println("Both books have the same price.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The books have different prices.");
        }
    }
}
