//Write a program to create a Car class with the following member variables: model, 
color, and speed. Implement the appropriate constructor and methods for this class.
Additionally, create a driver class to:
i. Instantiate two Car objects.
ii. Compare the cars based on their speed.
iii. Print the details of the car with the greater speed.
Note: Implement the Comparable interface and override the compareTo() method.
